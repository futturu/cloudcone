Installing and Configuring WordPress
You can download the latest version of the WordPress source from the official website. You can get the latest version of WordPress by running the following command:

wget http://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz
Once download is finished, extract the downloaded file with the following command:

tar -xzvf latest.tar.gz
Next, move the extracted files to the Apache web root directory:

sudo cp -avr wordpress/* /var/www/html/
Next, create a directory for WordPress to store uploaded files:

sudo mkdir /var/www/html/wp-content/uploads
Next, assign proper ownership and permissions to your WordPress files and folders:

sudo chown -R apache:apache /var/www/html/
sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/html/
Next, you will need to make some changes in the WordPress main configuration file, so it can be connected with the database and user.

First, rename and edit the WordPress main configuration file:

cd /var/www/html/
sudo mv wp-config-sample.php wp-config.php
sudo nano wp-config.php
Change the DB_NAME, DB_USER, and DB_PASSWORD variables as shown below:

define('DB_NAME', 'wordpress');
define('DB_USER', 'user');
define('DB_PASSWORD', 'password');
Save and close the file when you are finished.

sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-service=https
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
Next, open your web browser and type the URL http://your-server-ip.
