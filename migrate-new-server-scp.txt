How to migrate user to the new server
1. Make user backup on the old server. In this example we will use admin as the reference.
v-backup-user admin


2. Copy tarball to the new server and place it in the /home/backup directory
scp /home/backup/admin.2014-01-14.tar new-server:/home/backup/
or
scp /backup/* root@panel.example.com:/backup/


3. Restore backup on the new server
v-restore-user admin admin.2014-01-14.tar



If you want to restore data under another user name, simply rename archive. If user name doesn't exist on the server, account will be created automatically.
mv /home/backup/admin.2014-01-14.tar /home/backup/newuser.2014-01-14.tar
v-restore-user newuser newuser.2014-01-14.tar
