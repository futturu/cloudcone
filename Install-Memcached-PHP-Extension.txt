Step #1: Install Memcached PHP Extension
First, clean-up yum:

yum clean all

As a matter of best practice weâ€™ll update our packages:

yum -y update

Then installing PHP Memcached extension and related packages is now as simple as running just one command::

yum -y install php-pecl-memcache

Step #2: Verify Installation
Restart memcached and httpd:

systemctl restart memcached
systemctl restart httpd

Use the following command to view information on the installed PHP modules:

php -m | grep memcache

And look for a response similar to:

memcache
